        I am a Computer Scientist and Climate Tech Founder passionate about using
        technology to solve real-world problems. My work focuses on building
        inclusive digital and AI-driven solutions that support climate action,
        reforestation, sustainable communities, and data-driven decision-making.
        <br /><br />
        I am the founder of <strong>Eco-AI</strong>, a climate technology initiative
        that leverages artificial intelligence, satellite data, mobile platforms,
        and USSD to support reforestation, deforestation monitoring, and community
        engagement — even in low-connectivity environments.
        <br /><br />
        I have hands-on experience in software development, networking,
        cybersecurity, and digital infrastructure, and I actively collaborate
        with innovators, institutions, and communities to turn ideas into impact.
